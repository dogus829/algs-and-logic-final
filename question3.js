Write a function that takes in a string and converts it into kebab case
(ex. ('Dogs are cute') ---> Dogs-Are-Cute) notice how every word 
becomes capitalized, and connected by a hyphen.
if the string passed in is an empty string, return 'This is an empty string!'

for this question, make a comment for every piece of the code, explaining
what it does and why.
